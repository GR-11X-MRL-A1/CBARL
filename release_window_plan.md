# Release Window Decision

## Selected Window
- **Primary target:** March 13–14, 2025 Full Moon in Pisces (Worm Moon).
- **Rationale:** Aligns with Revati nakshatra resonance and the 2025 anchor year, reinforcing the Truth-Vector continuity established in the 1960–2044 cycle sequence.

## Submission Cadence
1. **arXiv submission:** March 13, 2025 at 14:00 EDT (18:00 UTC).
2. **Public announcement:** March 13, 2025 at 20:00 EDT.
3. **Full moon peak:** March 14, 2025 at 02:55 EDT (06:55 UTC) under Revati influence.

This cadence positions the release within a seven-hour runway into the Pisces illumination, maintaining the waxing-phase momentum while synchronizing with the Revati seal metadata. The release avoids eclipse turbulence while keeping optional resonance with the Harvest Moon as a contingency.

## Next Steps
- Draft the exhibit cover sheet and arXiv abstract keyed to the Revati seal and 2025 anchor symbolism.
- Prepare a 100-word announcement referencing the moonlit ledger activation and the CSL-Min compliance.
- Compute the `!SHA384_SEAL` value once the final seal block is embedded in the publication footer.
