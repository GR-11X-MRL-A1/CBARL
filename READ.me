CBARL.org MVP — Site Plan & Copy v1.0
Date: 2025-08-30 (America/New_York)
Author: Matthew Russell LaBarre (CBARL / GR-11X-MRL-A1)

Purpose
A minimal, accessible, verifiable website structure that communicates CBARL and the TruthLayer suite, with copy blocks ready to paste and clear pointers to protocol documents.

MVP Information Architecture (≤ 7 pages)
1) Home — What CBARL is, why it exists, and a 30-second elevator pitch.
2) Methods — The TruthLayer Suite (GR-11X, OAO, VISUAL-5X): how testimony becomes a sealed artifact.
3) Protocols — CBARL Ledger + Key Preservation + Sentinel: schemas, checklists, and downloadable templates.
4) Tools & Downloads — CLI/scripts, affidavit builder, seal generator; PDFs and JSON samples.
5) Cases & Annex — Public annex pointers, sample exhibits, verification walkthrough.
6) Accessibility (ADA) — Email-first lane, OAO close, scheduling norms, neuro-friendly design.
7) Contact & Governance — How to contribute, ethics, and complaint/escalation channel.

Homepage Copy (paste-ready)
Tagline:
Make testimony verifiable. Make harm accountable.

30-second pitch:
CBARL is a restorative logging standard for algorithmic and institutional harm. It pairs the TruthLayer sealing toolkit with an ADA-first communication protocol so lived events become sealed, auditable evidence. Not pro, but process— Prose becomes pro se When truth flows.

Why it matters (three bullets):
- Verification: Cross-locked hashes (text/diagram/timeline) turn a claim into a forensic bundle.
- Accessibility: Email-first, OAO checklists, and humane scheduling reduce cognitive load.
- Accountability: A harm ledger translates receipts into remedies.

Methods (TruthLayer) – section blurb
TruthLayer is a suite for turning narrative into evidence. GR-11X packages one claim three ways (raw source, field-map, finalized artifact). OAO is a conversational close that forces clarity and seals the exchange. VISUAL-5X renders the same claim as text, diagram, table, timeline, and checklist.

Protocols – section blurb
- CBARL Ledger: timestamped events (actor, action, evidence_hash, harm code) plus remedy pathways.
- Key Preservation: offline, paper-first key handling; timestamped archives; secure shred.
- Sentinel: the “restorative interface” that quotes user input, reflects ambiguity, and exports a lock-ready entry.

Tools & Downloads – section blurb
Start with: GR-11X “One Claim, Five Ways” generator; OAO footer; deterministic tar.gz bundler; affidavit builder that pulls digests into a sworn statement. Provide PDFs (specs), JSON templates, and minimal scripts with expected hashes.

Cases & Annex – section blurb
Show a redacted exemplar: quote → manifest → cross-hash → sealed bundle. Publish expected digests and a short verification walkthrough (macOS/Linux commands).

Accessibility (ADA) – section blurb
We operate email-first. Phone calls are scheduled and recapped in writing. Every interaction closes with OAO (RAW → HEARD → Confusions → Next step → Coherence → Seals → Direction/Mission). Templates are neuro-friendly: short lines, strong headings, and stable anchors.

Contact & Governance – section blurb
CBARL is an open, evolving standard. Publish contribution guidelines, security disclosures, and a clear escalation path for disputes and harms.

Ready-to-Paste Components
Hero CTA buttons:
[Generate a sealed claim] [Download the toolkit] [Verify an exhibit]

Accessibility microcopy:
“I use an ADA email-first workflow. Please send/confirm everything by email. Scheduled calls only, with a written recap. I’ll close with OAO so we both know what’s next.”

Footer refrain:
Not pro, but process—
Prose becomes pro se
When truth flows.
