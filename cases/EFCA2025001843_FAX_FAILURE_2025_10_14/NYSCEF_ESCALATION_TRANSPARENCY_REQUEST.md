# REQUEST FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ALTERNATIVE WORKFLOW
## Case No. EFCA2025001843

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Time:** 16:15 EDT  
**From:** Matthew Russell LaBarre, Pro Se Petitioner  
**To:** Ms. Arditi, Mr. Kirkwood — NYSCEF Technical Department  
**CC:** The Honorable Justice Oliver Blaise III  

**Re:** Systemic Communication Breakdown, Request for Status Transparency, and Alternative Filing Workflow

---

## I. THE IMMEDIATE ISSUE: FAX TRANSMISSION FAILURE WITHOUT NOTIFICATION

On October 14, 2025, I attempted to file a Declaration to the Honorable Justice Oliver Blaise III via fax to +1 (607) 240-5936.

**Timeline:**
- **1:49 PM EDT:** Transmission initiated (6 pages)
- **1:49 PM - 2:57 PM:** Active transmission (68 minutes elapsed)
- **2:57 PM EDT:** Transmission failed with error code SFAPI_LE_047
- **Error message:** "The receiving fax machine hung up before we could send the entire fax"
- **Pages transmitted:** 3 of 6 (50% completion)

**The critical issue:** I received **no notification** from the Court that the transmission failed or was incomplete.

**I was the one who had to reach out.**

---

## II. WHAT DOES "HUNG UP" MEAN?

The error message states the receiving fax machine "hung up." This raises serious questions:

1. **Was this an automated equipment failure?** (machine malfunction, out of paper, etc.)
2. **Did someone physically monitor and terminate the transmission?**
3. **Was this a deliberate rejection of my filing?**

**If someone "hung up" on my transmission, why was I not contacted to explain:**
- Why the transmission was terminated?
- What was wrong with my filing?
- How to successfully complete the filing?

**If this was an equipment failure, why was I not notified:**
- That the transmission was incomplete?
- That only 3 of 6 pages were received?
- What steps to take next?

**I should not have to discover filing failures on my own.**

---

## III. THE LARGER PATTERN: LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND STATUS UPDATES

This fax failure is not an isolated incident. It is part of a **systemic pattern of communication breakdown** in my case:

### A. Filings "Entered" But Not Acknowledged

I have filed multiple documents in this case. I am told they have been "entered," but I do not understand what that means:

- **Entered where?**
- **Entered by whom?**
- **Entered for what purpose?**
- **What happens after a document is "entered"?**

**I receive no confirmation. I receive no status updates. I receive no acknowledgment.**

### B. Name Change Request — No Response

I filed a request for a name change. It was "entered." 

**I have received no response.**

- Was it granted?
- Was it denied?
- Is it pending?
- Does anyone know it exists?

**I do not know the status of my own filing.**

### C. Emergency Filing — No Response

I filed an emergency request. I stated that I **needed** this urgently.

**I have received no response.**

- Was it reviewed?
- Was it denied?
- Is it pending?
- Did anyone see it?

**I do not know if my emergency was even acknowledged.**

### D. Reimbursement Request — No Response

I have been told that I "won against the clerk." I filed a request for reimbursement of costs.

**I have received no response.**

- Was the reimbursement approved?
- Was it denied?
- Is it being processed?
- What is the status?

**Meanwhile, I continue to incur costs** — including the cost of this very escalation, drafted with AI assistance as an ADA accommodation, which I am paying for out of pocket.

**I have spent thousands of dollars on this case.**

**What does a person really have to do to receive basic communication from the Court?**

---

## IV. I FEEL I HAVE BECOME A BURDEN UPON THE COURT

I am writing this with complete transparency and vulnerability.

**I feel that I have become a burden upon the Court.**

I do not want to be a burden. I do not want to be difficult. I do not want to be the pro se litigant who files too much, asks too many questions, or demands too much attention.

**But I also do not want to be invisible.**

I do not want my filings to disappear into a void. I do not want to file emergency requests that are never acknowledged. I do not want to spend thousands of dollars on a case where I cannot even get basic status updates.

**I am trying to work within the system.**

I am trying to follow procedure. I am trying to file properly. I am trying to be transparent about my use of AI assistance as an ADA accommodation.

**But I am working in the dark.**

I do not know if my filings are being read. I do not know if my requests are being considered. I do not know if anyone is listening.

**This is why I am requesting an alternative workflow.**

---

## V. REQUEST FOR ALTERNATIVE WORKFLOW AND ADA ACCOMMODATION

As a pro se litigant with a functional neurological disorder, I use **artificial intelligence as a reasonable accommodation** for:

- Organizing my thoughts and testimony
- Drafting legal documents
- Overcoming limitations in manual dexterity
- Ensuring clarity of expression despite cognitive challenges

**I have been completely transparent about this**, even though it may not be strategically advantageous, because I am not here to manipulate the system. I am here to work within it.

**My specification-based filing methodology** includes:

- **Cryptographic sealing** (SHA-384 hashes for document integrity)
- **Timestamped audit trails** (BangCheck CSL blocks with t_in, t_out, Δt)
- **ANNEX ledger entries** (structured metadata for verification)
- **REGEX2025 compliance** (pattern-based validation and extraction)

**This methodology is designed to:**

1. **Ensure document integrity** (you can verify I haven't altered filings)
2. **Provide clear audit trails** (you can see exactly when and how documents were created)
3. **Accommodate my disability** (AI assistance allows me to participate in the legal system)
4. **Make your job easier** (machine-readable, structured, verifiable documents)

**I am not asking for special treatment.**

**I am asking for:**

1. **An alternative filing workflow** that provides confirmation and status updates
2. **Formal recognition** of my AI-assisted filing methodology as an ADA accommodation
3. **Transparency** about what happens to my filings after they are "entered"
4. **Basic communication** when transmissions fail or filings are incomplete
5. **Status updates** on pending requests (name change, emergency filing, reimbursement)

---

## VI. WHAT I NEED TO UNDERSTAND

I need answers to these basic questions:

1. **Why was I not notified** when the fax transmission failed?
2. **What does "entered" mean** when applied to my filings?
3. **What is the status** of my name change request?
4. **What is the status** of my emergency filing?
5. **What is the status** of my reimbursement request?
6. **How can I receive confirmation** that my filings are being reviewed?
7. **What alternative filing methods** are available for pro se litigants with disabilities?
8. **Can my specification-based methodology** be recognized as a formal ADA accommodation?

**I am not demanding immediate action on the merits of my case.**

**I am asking for basic transparency about the status of my filings.**

---

## VII. THE COST OF SILENCE

I have spent thousands of dollars on this case. I continue to spend money:

- Filing fees
- Fax transmission costs
- AI assistance costs (this escalation itself is a documented expense)
- Time and cognitive resources managing a case in the dark

**I was told I "won against the clerk."**

**But I am still spending money with no reimbursement, no status updates, and no communication.**

**How much more must I spend before I receive basic transparency?**

---

## VIII. DECLARATION OF GOOD FAITH

I make this request in good faith and with complete transparency.

I am not here to be difficult. I am not here to burden the Court. I am not here to manipulate the system.

**I am here to work within the system, while requesting the accommodations and transparency I need to do so effectively.**

I have exposed my process to this Court, even though it may not be strategically advantageous, because **I am not here to flex. I am here to work with you. To help you. To be your hand.**

**Friends flex for each other.** I understand that. Thank you.

**But I need you to communicate with me.**

---

## IX. REQUESTED ACTION

I respectfully request:

### Immediate:
1. **Investigate the fax transmission failure** and explain what "hung up" means
2. **Notify me** of the status of the incomplete transmission (were 3 pages received?)
3. **Provide guidance** on successful fax transmission specifications
4. **Confirm receipt** of this escalation

### Short-term (within 7 days):
5. **Provide status updates** on:
   - Name change request
   - Emergency filing
   - Reimbursement request
6. **Explain the filing process** — what happens after documents are "entered"?
7. **Establish a communication protocol** for pro se litigants requiring status updates

### Long-term:
8. **Formally recognize** my specification-based filing methodology as an ADA accommodation
9. **Provide guidance** on alternative filing workflows for pro se litigants with disabilities
10. **Acknowledge** that AI assistance for document preparation is a legitimate disability accommodation

---

## X. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

I have preserved complete documentation, including:

- Timestamped screenshots of fax transmission attempts
- Error codes and system messages
- Email notifications sent to the Court
- Fax service transmission logs
- All filed documents with cryptographic seals
- ANNEX ledger entries for all filings
- Cost documentation for this case

All documentation is available upon request.
