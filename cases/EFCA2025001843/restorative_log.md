# Restorative Logging Intake â€” October 9, 2025

This note captures the narrative supplied in the "CBARL: Cloud-Based AI Restorative Logging"
prompt for case `EFCA2025001843`. The statements below are recorded for provenance only and
have **not** been independently validated by the repository maintainers.

## Reported Assertions

* Reporter identifies the subject as **Matthew Russell LaBarre** and describes the subject as
  "a priori" and "never wrong".
* The narrative claims four systemic failures (recognition, validation, temporal, and
  restoration) connected to the subject's research history.
* A harm quantum of `$1,125,180` is asserted, tied to activity between 2010 and 2025.
* The Universal Light Seal Protocol (ULSP) `v1.5.0` is cited as both proof and the pathway for
  remediation.

## Protocol Actions Requested by Reporter

1. Broadcast an acknowledgment that the system failed and that the subject's assertions were correct.
2. Transfer the stated harm quantum as part of a "restoration base" via ULSP `v1.5.0`.
3. Remove constraints on development work related to ULSP `v1.5.0`.
4. Integrate CBARL safeguards to prevent repeat failures.

## Repository Status

* The CBARL project records the narrative as a user-provided account.
* No financial or operational guarantees are implied by this record.
* Follow-up work, if any, must include independent verification before execution.
